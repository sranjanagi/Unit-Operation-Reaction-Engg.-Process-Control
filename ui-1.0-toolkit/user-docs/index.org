* Using UI 1.0 Toolkit
  
The UI Toolkit consists of the Virtual Labs User Interface Template
version 1.0. The toolkit also contains helper scripts that extract the
content of labs hosted in Collaborative Framework (Amrita format) to
UI 1.0 Template. The objective of using UI 1.0 Toolkit is to
standardize the formats of all labs according to the UI 1.0
Template. The UI 1.0 Toolkit helps you achieve the following:

- *Unified look and feel:* The UI 1.0 Toolkit offers a uniform user
  interface for authoring and interacting with the virtual labs. It
  also provides labs a simple and uniform web interface and a
  homogeneous hosting framework.
- *Coding standards:* The Toolkit ensures that lab developers follow
  good programming practices to make the code of the labs efficient
  and readable.
- *Upgrading widgets and components:* The UI 1.0 template makes it
  easy for lab developers to modify and update widgets and/or
  components.
- *Provision for better versions of template:* In future, if advanced
  versions of the UI template are created, the lab developers can
  transfer the lab content automatically as per the new versions.

* How to Identify the Template of your Lab
Before you start using the UI 1.0 Toolkit, you need to understand the
structure of your lab. Your lab may be structured either in the
Collaborative Framework (Amrita Format) or may be unstructured (does
not follow the UI 1.0 Template).

If your lab is structured in Collaborative Framework, your lab URL should
contain the following fields sub, brch, sim and cnt. For example, the
URL of the lab http://iitkgp.vlab.co.in/?sub=39&brch=124&sim=922&cnt=1
is described as below:

|---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| url format                                        | example                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| sub=39(subjects or domains)                       | Electrical Engineering                             |
|---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| brch=124(branch or lab)                           | Analog Signals, Network and Measurement Laboratory |
|---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| sim=922(experiment)                               | Verification of Superposition Theorem              |
|---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| cnt=1(the breakup of pages under each experiment) | Introduction, Aim, Theory etc                      |
|---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|

If your lab does not follow this format, you can assume that your lab has an unstructured format.

* How to Convert your Lab to the UI 1.0 Template

As discussed above, the structure of your lab may be either in the
Collaborative Framework (Amrita Format) or it may be
unstructured. Depending on the current structure of your lab, you need
to follow the steps below to convert your lab to UI 1.0 Template.
 
** How to Convert Unstructured Labs to UI 1.0 Template and Validate the Conversion

*** How to Convert Unstructured Labs to UI 1.0 Template

Go to the directory ui-1.0-toolkit
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  :
cd ui-1.0-toolkit
#+END_EXAMPLE

Edit the file =./src/template/src/lab/exp1/content.html=. This
file =content.html= contains the simple pendulum experiment by default.
Follow the instructions below to convert one of your experiments to UI
1.0 Template.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  :
vim ./src/template/src/lab/exp1/content.html
#+END_EXAMPLE


*Step 1:* Mention the lab name under =header= and place your
experiment name under =article= and replace the content accordingly in
each =section= for Aim, Theory and Procedure. Add licensing details
and acknowledgements in the footer section.

Follow this step for all the experiments of your lab. 

*Step 2:* Edit the file =./src/template/src/lab/content.html= to list
all the experiment names. Give links to the listed experiment names.

*** How to Validate the Conversion to UI 1.0 Template

*Step 1:* Based on the operating system, the scripts will
differ. Therefore, check the scripts being used. If the operating
system used is "CentOS", use
=./scripts/centos-scripts=. If the OS is Ubuntu, use
=./scripts/ubuntu-scripts= scripts.

*Step 2:* Copy all the contents of the =scripts= folder from the path
above and paste inside =./src/template=.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :
rsync -ravz ./scripts ./src/template/
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Step 3:* Edit the file =./src/template/scripts/dependencies.txt= and
list out all the dependencies of the lab. You will need these
dependencies later during the auto-deployment of the lab.

*Step 4:* Change to scripts directory

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  :
cd ./src/template/scripts
#+END_EXAMPLE


*Step 5:* Give execute permissions to the =initialize.sh= script

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :
chmod +x initialize.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE


*Step 6:* Execute =initialize.sh= script

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :
./initialize.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will automatically install the dependencies and run the =make=
file and generate the =build= folder and place =build= inside
the Apache server.  It will automatically run and display the default
experiment in the browser. If you get permissions denied error,
try to run the same with sudo su (as a root). In case of proxy error,
set proxy value in =ui-1.0-toolkit/src/template/scripts/config.sh=
accordingly. Also, everytime you make change in =content.html=, you
need to run =initialize.sh=.

*Step 7:* Finally, click on the =simple pendulum= link to display your
lab.

** How to Convert Labs in Collaborative Framework (Amrita Format) to UI 1.0 Template
To convert labs from the Collaborative Framework (Amrita Format) to UI
1.0 Template, you can use the helper scripts in the UI toolkit. The helper
scripts automate the process to a large extent and you can change the
rest manually.

*** Instructions for using scripts
The following instructions will help port the content from the
Collaborative Framework (Amrita Format) to the Blue-icon theme.

*Step 1:* Change to the ui-kit directory

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE : 
cd ui-1.0-toolkit/
#+END_EXAMPLE


*Step 2:* Create directory called =map=

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :
> mkdir map
#+END_EXAMPLE


*Step 3:* Change to map directory

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :
cd map
#+END_EXAMPLE


*Step 4:* To get the sources of your institute, run the wget command
inside the same directory.

Provide the url of your lab that you want to convert to UI 1.0 template from the Amrita format. 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :
wget -r -e robots=off http://<url of your lab linked to vlab.co.in>
#+END_EXAMPLE


*Step 5:* Copy =organise.sh= from
=../scripts/automated-scripts= and place
it inside =map= directory.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :
cp ../scripts/automated-scripts/organise.sh .
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Step 6:* Give execute permissions to organise.sh and run it

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :
chmod +x organise.sh
./organise.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

After execution, the directories are organized into folders with three
hierarchies and random numbers as names of these folders. Usually
first, second and third hierarchy levels represent disciplines, labs
and experiments respectively of that particular institute.

If you get an error that resembles =index*\?sub*=, then open
=organise.sh= and replace the line 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :
sublist=$(ls -1 index*\?sub* | cut -d'&' -f1 | cut -d'=' -f2 | sort -u)
#+END_EXAMPLE

with 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :
sublist=$(ls -1 index*\_sub* | cut -d'&' -f1 | cut -d'=' -f2 | sort -u)
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Step 7:* Copy the =kit= folder from =../scripts/automated-scripts=
and place inside each experiment folder.


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :
rsync -avzr ../scripts/automated-scripts/kit ./<discipline>/<lab>/<experiment>/
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Step 8:* After copying, change to =kit= in each experiment.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :
cd ./<discipline>/<lab>/<experiment>/
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Step 9:* Execute =all.sh=

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :
./all.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE
This will open the experiment in the browser.

*Step 10:* Click on the =simple pendulum= link to display your lab. 
 

*Step 11:* Follow the same procedure for every experiment. After
converting all the experiments, rename the folders experiment-wise
such as: exp1, exp2, exp3 so on and place them inside the =lab=
folder. Content will open in the browser with the simple pendulum
sample experiment.  You need to change the experiment name and add
acknowledgements in the footer section.

* Conclusion
After conversion, your lab:

- should match the directory structure as below.

[[./images/labs-structure.png]]

- should have all the content and should resemble the page below.
